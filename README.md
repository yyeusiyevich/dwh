# Data Warehousing
![python_logo.jpg](logo.jpg)
This project represents a data warehouse that centralizes, organizes, and enriches the data derived from Iowa Liquor sales, spanning from 2022 to the present day. The goal of this endeavor was to create a potent decision-support system that provides an elaborate platform for detailed business analysis and strategic planning.
The data warehouse system employs a hybrid approach to data modeling, ensuring the data's high flexibility, usability, and integrity. We initially capture data in a Staging Area, which serves as a preliminary repository allowing raw data to be cleaned and standardized. The data is then moved into the 3NF layer, a normalized design structure that eradicates data redundancy and maintains data consistency. The final dimensional layer adeptly balancing simplicity and structure detail, enabling both ad-hoc queries and more complex analytics. Star and Snowflake schemas are also represented in the additional materials.
In this DWH were efficiently incorporated various types of Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD), including Type 2, 5, and 6. This feature effectively tracks historical changes, attributes changes, and supports hybrid changes in the data, adding more depth to our analyses and enabling a complete view of business processes over time.
The loading mechanisms into the data warehouse are flexible and efficient, utilizing techniques such as partitioning and load-date tracking. There are two basic strategies: full and incremental load, accommodating both complete dataset reloads and smaller updates, thus ensuring the optimal usage of resources and maintaining the currency and relevance of the data.
The project also includes a robust testing environment that guarantees the quality of data within the warehouse. Moreover, I've developed various analytical functions to deliver insights and facilitate decision-making based on the data.
In essence, this data warehouse project provides a comprehensive platform that transforms raw Iowa Liquor sales data into valuable business insights. It ensures data quality, optimizes data management, and delivers advanced analytics capabilities. This system is a versatile tool for both operational and strategic decision-making processes in the beverage alcohol industry.
